Every year, thousands of people come to Austin, TX for the annual [SXSW festival](http://sxsw.com/). And every year it sets record numbers of participants. The question aries every year what makes it a success every year. What drives droves of people from across the globe to the city for South by? The event is so large, that there is not a single reason it has been so successful-- but I think there are a few reasons I think it is.

## Anything can happen

From [impromptu concerts by Jack White](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7yky2C9Gk), to [Twitter?s launch](http://laughingsquid.com/twitter-wins-sxsw-web-award/), and even [Bill Murray serving tequila](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwwEGjGbxXM)--- anything can happen at SXSW. My favorite encouter was a few years back, where I was able to be the [Jeffrey Zeldman's](http://www.zeldman.com/) "Sherpa" for his presentation. I have met many other of my industry's movers and shakers, as well as some of the [more](http://ronenv.com/) [interesting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin_Supreme) [people](https://twitter.com/timoreilly) in the world. In short, you never know what is going to happen any day of SXSW. It is just important to keep your eyes and ears open, and be ready for what the day might bring.

## Amazing content

Every year [Hugh Forrest](https://twitter.com/Hugh_W_Forrest), [Shawn O'Keefe](https://twitter.com/shawnokeefe) and the rest of the SXSWi team bring in some of the best speakers across the globe. With that comes not just amazing content, but also sparks of great conversation. SXSW stems new and interesting ideas at every turn. I spend most of the week thinking about what the year is going to bring and what ideas are ready for my current projects.

This content is not even a third of what SXSW has to offer. There is also film, featuring amazing content from film makers from across the globe. SXSWedu is going on already, sharing innovations across the world of education. Of course, the foundation of SXSW, music, where huge artists, rising stars, and international groups come together and light Austin up with music.

## Parties, parties everywhere

I have two rules for SXSW, do not pay for your drinks (but tip your bartender) and do not wait to get into an event. Luckily, there are so many event's across the city, there is always an event ready to meet and greet new people. Certainly, Austinites love the free events that come with SXSW, and I could not agree more. Just remember to RSVP to the events you want to go to, and do not be afraid to find the smaller events all over the city.

## An adventure on every corner

SXSW is one of the most exciting weeks of the year.
