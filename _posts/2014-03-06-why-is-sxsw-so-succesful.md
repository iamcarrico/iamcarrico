Every year, thousands of people come to Austin, Texas, for the annual [SXSW festival](http://sxsw.com/). And each year it sets record numbers for participants and partygoers that attend. What drives droves of people from across the globe to the city for SXSW? The event is so large that there is not a single reason behind its success, but many. Here are a few I find compelling.

## Anything can happen

From [impromptu concerts by Jack White](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7yky2C9Gk), to [Twitter's launch](http://laughingsquid.com/twitter-wins-sxsw-web-award/), and even [Bill Murray serving tequila](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwwEGjGbxXM)--- anything can happen at SXSW. My favorite encouter was a few years back, where I was able to be [Jeffrey Zeldman's](http://www.zeldman.com/) impromptu "Sherpa" prior to his presentation. I have met many of my industry's movers and shakers, as well as some of the [more](http://ronenv.com/) [interesting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin_Supreme) [people](https://twitter.com/timoreilly) in the world. In short, you never know what is going to happen any day of the festival. It is just important to keep your eyes and ears open in order to be ready for what the day might bring.

## Austin's weather

Mid-March in Austin usually comes with temperate climate. Excluding a few years, the weather has been bright and warm. It is a great time to get out of the seasonably cold weather of the north to enjoy some good southern sun. Even this year, with Austin's varying weather in March, it is looking like the week will be quite beautiful overall.

## Amazing content

Every year [Hugh Forrest](https://twitter.com/Hugh_W_Forrest), [Shawn O'Keefe](https://twitter.com/shawnokeefe) and the rest of the SXSW Interactive team brings in some of the best speakers across the globe. With these speakers comes not just amazing content, but also sparks great conversation. SXSW inspires new and interesting ideas at every turn. I spend most of the week thinking about what the year is going to bring and what new ideas I can apply to my current project.

Interactive content is not even a third of what SXSW has to offer. The festival also has film, featuring amazing content by talented filmmakers from across the globe. SXSWedu has already begun and they have been sharing innovations across the world of education. Of course, the foundation of SXSW is the music. The music where huge artists, rising stars, and international groups come together and fill Austin's streets, parks, and bars with new and inspiring sounds.

## Parties, parties everywhere

I have two rules for the participants SXSW. First, do not pay for your drinks, but always tip your bartender. Second, do not wait to get into a party. During the festival are many events across the city, and there is always a place ready to meet and greet new people. Austinites love the free events that come with SXSW, and I could not agree more. Just remember to RSVP to the events you want to go to and to explore the smaller events all over the city. Some of the bests nights I have had were at holes in the wall on the east side.

## An adventure on every corner

So to all of you coming to Austin, welcome! Take in all that the city and SXSW has to offer this week. I look forward to seeing what the festival has in store, and what new innovations (and bands) come out of it.
