I have been asked before what news sources I use at the present moment to stay up-to-date on the current affairs. With the proliferation of various news sites across the internet, it is sometimes difficult to know what sources are trustworthy. While this list is by no means perfect, it at least gives a glimpse of what I use. I try to make at least my daily news to be as centrist as possible, although certainly some of the more occasional outlets I read are more liberally biased.

## Daily news

These are news sources that I look at on a daily basis. I try and focus on world news for these, keeping up with what is happening at home and abroad.

### [Voice of America, International Edition](http://www.voanews.com/archive/international-edition/latest/672/1451.html)
_(Centrist)_

The Voice of America (VOA) is a US government-funded news source that is broadcast aground the globe. According to their charter "VOA news will be accurate, objective and comprehensive." I listen to their international edition podcast every morning, which does include some US news.

### [BBC World Service](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nq0gn/episodes/downloads)
_(Centrist)_

I also listen to the BBC World Service podcast every morning. They give a great view of the world, and US politics, from an international perspective.

### [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/)
_(Centrist)_

I get the "Brookings Brief" sent to my inbox every morning with a couple analyses that the Brookings Institute has done. Most of their work can be considered politically centrist.

## Other Periodicals

These are the periodicals that do not arrive daily. Most of these are weekly editions, and I peruse throughout the week. Some come more often, although I only listen to them occasionally.


### [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/)
_([Difficult to say](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/economist-explains-itself-0))_

Probably one of the most well-rounded periodicals available, The Economist is a mixture of current news with a focus on business and economics. It definitely has an editorial stance, but it is not conservative or liberal in a traditional sense.

### [Harvard Kennedy School PolicyCast](http://hkspolicycast.org/)
_(Academic)_

A weekly podcast on public policy, hosted by [Matt Cadwallader](https://twitter.com/mattcad). It features guests from the Harvard Kennedy School, and leaders from across the globe.

### [The CSIS Podcast](https://www.csis.org/podcasts/csis-podcast)
_(Centrist)_

Colm Quin interviews the big stories in US policy and foreign affairs, all through the lens of the experts the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

### [Vox's The Weeds](http://www.vox.com/the-weeds)‡
_(Liberal)_

Hosted by Matt Yglesias, Sarah Kliff, and Ezra Klein— The Weeds dives into the weeds (get it?) of policy in the United States. Most of their content is built to be more ever green than most weekly podcasts, but it is still a great way to have a broad understanding of the policy happening today.

### [Here and Now](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow)†
_(Centrist)_

I listen to Here and Now during my lunch hour, and while driving around town often. It provides great coverage of the news of the day, going deep into what is going on today in the news.


## Occasional Articles

These are places that I will read either on the road, or specific articles as they show up— but do not seek out content from them on a periodic basis. Most of the liberal bias I have with my news comes from these sources. Although, when it comes to large publications (e.g. NY Times) their bias comes in the opinion section (I do not read) and with the stories they select— not necissarily with the content as much.

[Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/)
_(Conservative)_

[Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/)†
_(Centrist)_

[Vox](http://www.vox.com/)‡
_(Liberal)_

[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/)
_(Liberal)_

[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com)
_(Liberal)_

[Slate](http://www.slate.com/)
_(Liberal)_

[Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/)
_(Liberal)_

## Wary About

All of these are places where while I might read something from them— I am wary about the content that they have. In the case of the first two, it is because their content is largely community-submitted, and does not go through much (if any at all) of an editorial review. Largely, the posts on both The Huffington Post and Medium are opinion pieces.

As for Vice, I have found that most of the content that comes from them is not without it's heavy bias. Their TV shows seem to give you just enough information to feel informed, although missing the full picture. While there are some great pieces by them (I am a big fan of [Gaycation](https://www.viceland.com/en_us/show/gaycation), for example), overall I do not trust them as reliable.

[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com)

[Medium](https://medium.com/)

[Vice](http://www.vice.com/en_us)

## Never Read

All of these news sources are incredibly biased, and rarely do they give any sort of factual basis for their news. They generally rely on very biased attention-grabbing headlines, and either gross negligence of the facts or distortion of the truth. This list could be much longer, as there are many new smaller sites popping up frequently— many of which do not have a high standard of journalistic integrity.

[Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.com/)
_(Conservative)_

[Addicting Info](http://www.addictinginfo.org/)
_(Liberal)_

[Alternet](http://www.alternet.org/)
_(Liberal)_

[Raw Story](http://www.rawstory.com/)
_(Liberal)_


## BONUS: Other Podcasts

What would a list of news sources be without an associated list of podcasts that I frequently listen to?
