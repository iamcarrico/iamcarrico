It is incredibly simple and easy to begin making awesome static sites or blogs, with very little effort. This month I am doing a 4 part series of blog posts on how to create, deploy and automate a site on Jekyll, all while ensuring it is as performant as possible. These tools are all used on my own site and several smaller sites that I have worked on. The code is all available on GitHub.</div></article><article class="blog-post teaser"><h2 class="title"><a href="/writings/why-is-sxsw-so-succesful/">Why is SXSW so successful?</a></h2><div class="metadatas"><span class="categories"><span class="category">sxsw</span></span> -  <span class="date">2014-03-06</span></div><div class="content">Every year, thousands of people come to Austin, Texas, for the annual SXSW festival. And each year it sets record numbers for participants and partygoers that attend. What drives droves of people from across the globe to the city for SXSW?

Today, I found one such article that was a compare and contrast to the benifits of having a mobile site vs having a responsive site. I will be the first to admit that rebuilding a site's front end to be responsive is not an cheap task. It takes time, money, and a team willing to redesign not just the look at feel, but also document hierarchy. But that difficulty should not be feared, it should be surmounted.</div></article><article class="blog-post teaser"><h2 class="title"><a href="/writings/i-am-no-designer/">I Am No Designer</a></h2><div class="metadatas"><span class="categories"><span class="category">jekyll</span> <span class="category">backend</span></span> -  <span class="date">2013-05-13</span></div><div class="content">There are many who would count me amongst designers, I am not one of those people. I work with desiners, I can see a good design from a bad one... but I am no designer. This is probably why after years of trying to make a fancy blog, something noteworthy, something catchy to the eye--- I opted instead to bring something simple to the board.
