Performance matters, but most people talk about it through the lens of product teams, not ad-based media companies. While more and more people are using the internet on their devices, and the use of ad blockers is on the riseâ€” media performance could not be more important.

This session will feature several members of major media companies (Vox, Conde Nast, Washington Post) and their team's working through media performance issues. The panel will share insight to how they approach performance at their respective companies, as well as the unique problems that are faced by media companies to make their websites faster.
